# ICDocument-Attribute-Detecion-and-Extraction

I use Tesseract-OCR for text detecion and extraction 
you can get Tesseract from : https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract/wiki
And, I use Haar Cascade for face detection.

the extraction results will be saved to the directory with the name extractionresult.txt and FaceImageExtract.jpg
